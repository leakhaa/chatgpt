| 1. Identify issue type    | IT manually reads message and interprets intent                 | AI model classifies the issue type (e.g., missing PO, ASN, mismatch) automatically        |
| 2. Extract key details    | Human parses PO/ASN/pallet ID from email                        | LLM extracts and validates PO, ASN, pallet IDs, and quantities from the message           |
| 3. Check existing records | IT manually queries WMS/DB/upstream system to verify status     | AI agent checks internal DBs/WMS for record presence and status                           |
| 4. Decision to act        | IT decides if action is needed (reset, trigger, escalate)       | AI decides if creation or correction is required based on data lookup                     |
| 5. Trigger action         | IT manually triggers upstream system or raises internal ticket  | AI sends upstream system/API call to create/link PO/ASN/pallet or auto-escalate           |
| 6. Monitor response       | IT waits for upstream system/mail response and monitors mailbox | AI auto-monitors mailbox for upstream system responses and matches it to original request |
| 7. User update            | IT replies manually with resolution status                      | AI sends structured resolution summary to user (email/chat)                               |
| 8. Audit trail            | Partial/manual tracking in emails                               | AI maintains complete, timestamped audit trail of actions taken                           |
